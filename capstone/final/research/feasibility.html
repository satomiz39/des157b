            <h4>A list of features I plan to include:</h4>         
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Drag and drop effect using jQuery or interact.js.</li>
                    <li>BounceInDown effect with animate.css for the text animation.</li>
                    <li>Hover over and pop-up effects to show information about each image of the seal..</li>
                    <li>npm JavaScript library for a confetti effect.</li>
                </ul>        
            </p>

            <h4>The technologies required to build each feature are as follows:</h4>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Photoshop for editing the seal image.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript and CSS libraries.</li>
                    <li>Figma for prototyping.</li>
                    <li>Visual Studio Code.</li>
                </ul>  
            </p> 

            <h4>An assessment of my skills with each technology required:</h4>              
            <p>
                I am not very confident in my current JavaScript skills, but I will do my best to utilize all the necessary tools and technologies. I have a fundamental knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, which are required to successfully complete the project.
            </p>
          
            <h4>The responsibilities of each partner are as follows:</h4>
            <p> 
                Initially, I planned to work on the seal project by myself. However, Jaclyn and I realized that we had quite a similar idea for this project, so we decided to collaborate.
                Jaclyn has already figured out how to create the seamless drag-and-drop effect with jQuery and CSS animation for text using animate.css. Therefore, I will focus on writing the content that will go into the pop-up and implementing it into each puzzle piece image. Additionally, I will be responsible for coding the CSS and JavaScript event to achieve the desired effect.

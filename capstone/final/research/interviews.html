                <h2>Inteview Summary</h2>  
                    <p>
                        For my Capstone Project, I chose to interview college students who were new to Davis. Specifically, I spoke with three of my cohorts from the MFA Design program who had moved to the city last fall. The following questions were posed to the interviewees: Damien Mitchell, Ladan Johari, and Pedro Ortiz:
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>How long have you lived in Davis?</li>
                        <li>What drew you to Davis?</li>
                        <li>What are your favorite things about Davis?</li>
                        <li>What surprises you about Davis?</li>
                        <li>Where and how do you spend time, both online and offline?</li>
                        <li>How do you prefer to communicate and with what tools/devices?</li>
                        <li>Have you researched Davis and/or its history?</li>
                        <li>Have you seen the city's seal?</li>
                        <li>What are the pain points (challenges, frustrations) about living in Davis?</li>
                    </ol> 
                       
                    <p>
                        The interviews revealed several key insights. Firstly, all three participants tended to use cell phones to search for things rather than laptops, except when studying. Additionally, all interviewees had researched Davis before moving in, as they were curious about the neighborhood and transportation system. However, only Pedro had read about the history of Davis, including the Patwin Native Americans, European immigration, and the development of the railroad.
                        
                        Lastly, all interviewees agreed that the cost of living in Davis was the most significant challenge. Overall, the interviews were an interesting experience, providing valuable insights into my target audience.

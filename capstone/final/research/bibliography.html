            <p class="paraNext">Benjamin, Ruha. Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code. Polity Press, 2019.</p>    
            <p>In this book, Benjamin argues that the digital age has brought about a new form of oppression that she has coined the "New Jim Code." This consists of a series of regulations and customs that utilize technology to marginalize and dominate people of color. The work is highly applicable to the study of technology's intersection with social justice, as Benjamin's examination of the New Jim Code provides a unique perspective on how technology perpetuates systemic racism.
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, her advocacy for "abolitionist tools" establishes a useful model for designing more equitable and just systems. A distinctive characteristic of this book is the author's emphasis on the responsibility of designers to produce technologies that advance social justice, which she illustrates with specific instances. In sum, this insightful and compelling book offers vital insights for anyone interested in exploring the social and ethical consequences of technology.

                In this chapter, the author discusses the importance of involving marginalized communities in the design process to ensure equitable outcomes. Costanza-Chock argues that designing with and for communities is critical for achieving design justice, which is the fair distribution of design benefits and burdens. The chapter is highly relevant to research on community engagement in design, providing many examples and case studies of community-led design projects, and practical advice for designing with communities. The chapter's unique contribution is its emphasis on centering the voices and experiences of marginalized communities in the design process.

                The author gives an overview of the principles of design justice and suggests several co-design strategies, including trust development, relationship building, and creating safe spaces for participation. As a scholar and practitioner working at the intersection of design, media, and social justice, Costanza-Chock highlights the importance of recognizing and addressing power imbalances in the design process. I found this chapter was a valuable resource for comprehending the principles of design justice and practical strategies for community-led design.

            <p class="paraNext">Simon, Nina. “Chapter 1: The Participatory Museum.” The Participatory Museum, Museum 2.0, 26 Feb. 2010, https://participatorymuseum.org/chapter1/.</p>    
            
            <p>Nina Simon's book emphasizes the significance of visitor participation in museums for increased engagement, learning, and community building. The first chapter introduces the concept of a participatory museum and its potential benefits for both visitors and museums. The chapter provides practical guidance on incorporating visitor input into exhibit design, interpretation, and programming and highlights the advantages of a participatory approach, such as increased visitor satisfaction, more meaningful learning experiences, and greater community involvement. Case studies of museums, such as the Brooklyn Museum and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, successfully implementing participatory practices are presented in the chapter. 
            </p>
            <p>The author argues that participatory museum design can transform cultural institutions into community hubs that promote dialogue, creativity, and social change. She stresses the importance of listening to visitors, empowering them to contribute their ideas and experiences, and collaborating with them to create meaningful experiences. This book provides a practical framework and useful advice for museums looking to incorporate participatory practices into their operations.

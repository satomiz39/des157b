            <p>I conducted user testing with Alyson, Daniel, and Laura. They provided insightful feedback on my seal project puzzle game. Here are the key findings during the testing:
            </p>
                
            <ol>
                <li>Users expressed a desire for more freedom in moving the puzzle pieces, especially on the left side. The current movement constraints were found to be limiting.</li> 

               <li>Users reported an issue where switching pieces on the right side prevented them from completing the puzzle. This functionality needs to be fixed to ensure a smooth user experience.</li>

                <li> Users found the buttons to be too small and the sound effects harsh. They suggested increasing the button size for easier interaction and making the sound effects less harsh to create a more pleasant user experience.</li>
            </ol>
               <p></p>
              
                <h4>Plan for Updating the Capstone Project:</h4>
                <ol>
                <li>Improve puzzle piece movement: Based on the feedback, I will revisit the movement constraints and provide users with more freedom to move puzzle pieces, especially on the left side. This will enhance the interaction and give users a smoother experience.</li>
                
                <li>Fix the issue with switching pieces: I will address the reported issue of switching pieces on the right side preventing users from completing the puzzle. By fixing this functionality, users will be able to switch pieces without hindering their progress, ensuring a seamless puzzle-solving experience.</li>
                
                <li>Enhance button size and sound effects: Taking into account the feedback regarding button size and sound effects, I will increase the size of the buttons to make them more accessible for users. Additionally, I will adjust the sound effects to be less harsh, creating a more enjoyable and pleasant user experience.</li>
                
                <li>By implementing these updates, the capstone project will address the user feedback and improve the overall puzzle application. These improvements will provide users with more control and flexibility, ensuring a smooth and engaging experience while learning about Davis's history.</li>
                </ol>

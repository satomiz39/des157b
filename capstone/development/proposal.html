            <p>My proposed topic is to create an interactive web design that allows people to explore the Davis Centennial Seal and learn about its historical stories. The target audience for this project is primarily new UC Davis students, including international students, who are interested in learning more about the history and identity of Davis.</p>

            <p>If possible, I plan to collaborate with a partner who preferably has a background in computer science. Together, I think we can aim to build an interactive web page that features different themes and stories associated with the Davis Centennial Seal.</p>
                
            <p>Some of the features that I envision for this project include a high-resolution photo of the Davis Centennial Seal, which allows people to see the details of each section. I plan to incorporate hover or click effects on each section of the seal, which would reveal a popup or tooltip with information about that section. Photos or illustrations will be included in the popups to help illustrate each story or theme. I would like to use clear and concise text that includes relevant historical or cultural information. I also plan to include links to further resources or information about each story or theme.</p>
                
            <p>As someone who is not confident in building and coding complicated interactive web sites using data, I anticipate potential technical challenges in ensuring that the hover or click effects work properly with the use of specific data and JavaScript. It might not work exactly as I envision at this moment, but I will do my best to make it happen.</p>
